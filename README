Description
-----------

"TvGuide" is a highly customizable 2D EPG viewer plugin.

Installation
------------

After "normal" Plugin installation you have to care about the paths for the
used Icons, the channel logos and epg images. The following paths can be set
at startup:

-l path, --logodir=path
    Path to the logos (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/tvguide/channellogos/).

-i path, --epgimages=path
    Path to the epgimages (Default: <vdrconfdir>/plugins/tvguide/epgimages/).

-c path, --icons=path
    Path to the icons directory (Default: <ressourcedir>/plugins/tvguide/epgimages/).

ResourceDirectory is taken from your VDR configuration (make.config or vdr.pc).

During a "make install" the Icons are automatically copied from <PlgSourceDirectory>/icons/
to the default path. Included Theme files are also copied from <PlgSourceDirectory>/themes/
to <ConfigDirectory>/themes/

I recommend to use channel logos from https://github.com/3PO/Senderlogos
To download them just change in the directory you want to place the logos
and do a:

git clone https://github.com/3PO/Senderlogos.git logos

An update of the logos can then be done with a "git pull" just inside this
directory.

For S2-6400 Users: Disable High Level OSD, otherwise the plugin will not be
loaded because lack of true color support

For Xine-Plugin Users: Set "Blend scaled Auto" as OSD display mode to achieve
an suitable true color OSD.

For Xineliboutput Users: Start vdr-sxfe with the --hud option enabled

Usage
-----

Remote Control Keys:

Up/Down/Left/Right:    Navigation in the EPG grid
Ok:                    Detailed EPG View of the selected grid
                       2nd Ok closes the detailed view

In Search & Recording menu the following options are available:

- Instant Record: create a timer for the currently selected program. An
  check for timer conflicts will be performed, if a timer conflict occurs,
  the involved timers can be adapted to solve the conflict.
- Delete / Edit Timer: if a timer already exists for the currently selected
  broadcast, this timer can be deleted or edited.
- Create Series Timer: create a periodical timer for a dedicated time on
  dedicated days.
- Create Search Timer: create an search timer with epgsearch. The most
  important options can be defined directly in the menu, alternatively
  epgsearch templates can be used to define the searchtimer options.

The navigation through the search & recording menu can be done easily with

jump directly to the top/bottom of the list.
