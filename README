Setup Options
-------------

* General:

- Number of Channels / Columns:				
  Number of columns per screen (max. 8)
  Keep in mind that the True Color OSD displays 64 Pixmaps in maximum, and each EPG
  entry is a dedicated Pixmap. So if this value is too large, maybe not all EPG
  information is shown on the screen.

- Channel Jump (Keys Green / Yellow):
  Number of channels to jump back / forward, counted from the currently selected
  channel (channel to which the selected EPG entry belongs)

- Time to display vertically in minutes
  With this value the number of minutes per screen is determinated. The value is
  an approximately value, because rounded values are used during calculation.
  int((OSD Height - Header Height - Footer Height) / value) 
  --> Number of Pixel for one minute

- Big Step (Keys 1 / 3) in hours
  Hours to jump vertically with keys 1 / 3
